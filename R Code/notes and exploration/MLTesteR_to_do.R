# For gaussian variance test, what is the power of the chi square test?
#
# Poisson
# Why does seed matter so much
#
# For binomial, Why does N have to be so large for tests to pass?
#
# Extend tests to multiple seeds
#
# Double check bounds on all parameters
#
# All tests assume large N. What should be the cut off?
