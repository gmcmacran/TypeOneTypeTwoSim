# All tests assume large N. What should be the cut off?
#
# For binomial, can a glm model be used to confirm results?
# Why does N have to be so large for tests to pass?
#
# Should gamma version be made? Textbook uses this as a case study
# of it wilk's theoem being a bad approximation. Tests currently fail.
#
# For negative binomial, find an exact test or some form of confirmation
# test is correct.
