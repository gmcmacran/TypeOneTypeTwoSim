# Repo Overview

This repo estimates asymptotic type I and type II error rates for
likelihood tests in MLTesteR. Detailed analysis can be found in the type
I and type II folders.

## Summary of Type I Error Rate

Most tests have a type I error rate of .05. Likelihood ratio tests match
exact tests.

## Summary of Type II Error Rate

Most tests can achieve near 0% type II error for a large enough effect
size. The test for a geometric distributionâ€™s p test does not.
