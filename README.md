# Repo Overview

This repo estimates asymptotic type I and type II error rates for
likelihood ratio tests in LRTesteR. Detailed analysis can be found in
the type I and type II folders. Calculations based on 5,000 iterations
and a sample size of 200.

# Summary of Type I Error Rate

Most tests have a type I error rate of .05. Likelihood ratio tests match
exact tests.

# Summary of Type II Error Rate

All tests can achieve near 0% type II error for a large enough effect
size.
